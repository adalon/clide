    /// Helper base class that can be used to provide transparent loading and saving of settings. 
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Derived classes typically expose an interface that is exported to the composition container, 
    /// and declares an importing constructor that receives the settings manager, which is already 
    /// exported in the environment by the runtime.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <example>
    /// The following is an example of a settings class:
    /// <code>
    /// [Settings]
    /// public class ServerSettings : Settings, IServerSettings
    /// {
    ///     public ServerSettings(ISettingsManager manager)
    ///         : base(manager)
    ///     {
    ///     }
    ///     
    ///     public string Name { get; set; }
    ///     public int Port { get; set; }
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// Note how the class specifies what is the exported settings interface 
    /// for other consuming code. Also, the imported settings manager is passed 
    /// to the base class which takes care of reading and saving the state as 
    /// necessary.
